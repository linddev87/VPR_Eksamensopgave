# VPR_Eksamensopgave

This project was created for an exam. 

It's a console app used to keep track of selected financial assets (Stocks, Crypto and Forex). 

The application consumes the Finnhub API to get day-to-day information on opening and closing prices as well as other relevant data for each asset. 

The app uses EntityFramework to maintain collected data in an MSSQL database.
